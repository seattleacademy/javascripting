/*
 ## The challenge:

  Create a file named looping-through-arrays.js.

  In that file, define a variable named pets that references this array:

     ['cat', 'dog', 'rat'];

  Create a for loop that changes each string in the array so that they are
  plural.

  You will use a statement like this inside the for loop:

     pets[i] = pets[i] + 's';

  After the for loop, use console.log() to print the pets array to the
  terminal.

  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

     javascripting verify looping-through-arrays.js
