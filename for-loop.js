/*
 ## The challenge:

  Create a file named for-loop.js.

  In that file define a variable named total and make it equal the number 0.

  Define a second variable named limit and make it equal the number 10.

  Create a for loop with a variable i starting at 0 and increasing by 1 each
  time through the loop. The loop should run as long as i is less than
  limit.

  On each iteration of the loop, add the number i to the total variable. To
  do this, you can use this statement:

     total += i;

  After the for loop, use console.log() to print the total variable to the
  terminal.

  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

     javascripting verify for-loop.js
