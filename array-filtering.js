/*
 ## The challenge:

  Create a file named array-filtering.js.

  In that file, define a variable named numbers that references this array:

     [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

  Like above, define a variable named filtered that references the result of
  numbers.filter().

  The function that you pass to the .filter() method will look something
  like this:

     function evenNumbers (number) {
       return number % 2 === 0;
     }

  Use console.log() to print the filtered array to the terminal.

  Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

     javascripting verify array-filtering.js
